# Optimism

Scripts to help run optimism node locally. [Source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

This folder should be deleted once the optimism tooling is improved and can be run as easily as `ganache-cli`.

# run-optimism.sh

Note that this script will clone the `etheruem-optimism/optimism` repo locally and run multiple docker containers that comprise a local Optimism node. These scripts assume that you are running Docker on localhost.
