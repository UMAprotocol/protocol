# Priceless DeFi Contracts

“Priceless” financial contracts are contracts that don’t require an on-chain price feed to function, and minimize on-chain oracle usage to reduce the frequency and surface area for oracle attacks.
They are designed with mechanisms to incentivize counterparties to properly collateralize their positions without requiring any on-chain price feed.
These mechanisms include a liquidation and dispute process that allows counterparties to be rewarded for identifying improperly collateralized positions.
Unless a position is liquidated, it is assumed to be solvent (properly collateralized).
Oracles are only used when a liquidation is disputed — which is designed to be rare.

## Priceless Synthetic Tokens

One can write priceless financial contract templates to create various kinds of financial products.
The UMA team has written one to create synthetic tokens.
These are ERC-20 tokens whose required backing collateral is determined by the value of a price identifier.
There is no on-chain price feed for the values of the price identifier; rather, token holders and token sponsors should monitor the value of this price identifier off-chain to inform their decisions about how much collateral to maintain on-chain.
If token sponsors are improperly collateralized, liquidators can liquidate token sponsors’ positions.
Improper liquidations can be disputed by disputers. Details on these mechanisms are available [here](../synthetic_tokens/explainer.md).
