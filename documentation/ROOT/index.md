# Getting Started

UMA builds open-source infrastructure for “priceless” financial contracts on Ethereum. Specifically, this is two things:

- Priceless financial contract designs, which can be used to create synthetic tokens
- Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), a decentralized oracle service

Together, these two technologies enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.

## General Information

If you would like to learn more about the concepts behind the DVM and priceless financial contracts, start by reading this [overview](../getting_started/architecture_overview.md) of the UMA ecosystem. The following sections go into additional detail on priceless DeFi contracts and the DVM.

## For Developers

If you are a developer interested in building with UMA’s technology, start with this [explainer](../synthetic_tokens/explainer.md) of how UMA's priceless synthetic tokens work, and then try out this [tutorial](../synthetic_tokens/tutorials/creating_from_truffle.md) for how to deploy your own token on testnet. You can find additional reference materials, including a list of UMA-supported mainnet and testnet deployments, [here](../developer_reference/contract_addresses.md).

## For Market Makers

If you are a market maker interested in market making or acting as a liquidator or disputer for financial products deployed with UMA’s priceless synthetic token template, you can find more information about the economic incentives for these roles in this [explainer](../synthetic_tokens/explainer.md) for synthetic tokens.

## For UMA Token Holders

If you are interested in the UMA project token, please read this [section](../oracle/governance/UMA_token_holder_responsibilities.md) to learn more about the role of the UMA project token in the DVM and the rights and responsibilities of UMA project token holders.

## Contracts

For a more detailed view, API documentation is available for all UMA smart contracts.
