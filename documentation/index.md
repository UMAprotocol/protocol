# Welcome to UMA Documentation

UMA builds decentralized infrastructure to allow developers to build financial applications. There are two primary
parts of this infrastructure: the decentralized oracle (DVM) and the financial contract templates that depend on it.

This documentation will explain the code as it exists today. For a more theoretical explanation of the UMA DVM, see
the [DVM whitepaper](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/whitepaper/blob/master/UMA-DVM-oracle-whitepaper.pdf). For a deeper
explanation of the philosophy behind the self-enforcing financial contract templates, see the
[financial contract template whitepaper](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/whitepaper/blob/master/UMA-whitepaper.pdf).

## Tutorials

If you'd like to start working with the UMA platform, we have a variety of tutorials that should help you get familiar
with the technology. A good place to start is the [prerequisites](./tutorials/prerequisites.md), which will be required
before working through any of the other tutorials.


## Explainers

To learn more about how the platform works, there are a few high-level explainers to help you conceptually understand
how parts of the system interact with one another. For a high-level introduction to how the decentralized oracle (DVM)
works, please see the [architecture overview](./explainers/architecture.md).

## Contracts

For a more detailed view, API documentation is available for all UMA smart contracts.
