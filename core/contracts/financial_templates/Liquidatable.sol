/**
@title Liquidatable
@notice Adds logic to a position-managing contract that enables callers to
liquidate an undercollateralized position.
@dev The liquidation has a liveness period before expiring successfully, during which
someone can "dispute" the liquidation, which sends a price request to the relevant
Oracle to settle the final collateralization ratio based on a DVM price. The
contract enforces dispute rewards in order to incentivize disputers to correctly
dispute false liquidations and compensate position sponsors who had their position
incorrectly liquidated. Importantly, a prospective disputer must deposit a dispute
bond that they can lose in the case of an unsuccessful dispute.
