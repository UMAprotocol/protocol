// TODO:
// - Events
// - Connect with Oracle/DVM
// - Partial liquidations: should be trivial to add
// - In order to ensure that positions with < 100% collateralization are disputed,
// the contract forces liquidators to liquidate the “least-collateralized” positions first.
// instead of "locked collateral" (actual amount of collateral locked in contract)

/**
 * Adds logic to a position-managing contract that enables callers to
 * "liquidate" an undercollateralized position. The liquidator must burn
 * an amount of synthetic tokens that they are "liquidating" in order to potentially
 * withdraw a portion of the locked collateral in an undercollateralized position.
 * The liquidation has a liveness period before expiring successfully, during which
 * someone can "dispute" the liquidation, which sends a price request to the relevant
 * Oracle to settle the final collateralization ratio based on a DVM price. The
 * contract enforces dispute rewards in order to incentivize disputers to correctly
 * dispute false liquidations and compensate position sponsors who had their position
 * incorrectly liquidated. Importantly, a prospective disputer must deposit a dispute
 * bond that they can lose in the case of an unsuccessful dispute.
