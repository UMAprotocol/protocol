# Provider App

## Install

All that's needed to install all required packages is running `npm install` from the `provider/` directory.

## Running

1. Make sure you have metamask or mist configured in your browswer and connected with the Ethereum mainnet.

1. In a separate terminal, run `npm run link-contracts && npm start` from the `provider/` directory. If you'd like to run the internal version of the dapp (includes additional information), replace `npm start` with `npm run start_internal` in the command above.

## Contributing

1. Before submitting a PR, be sure to run `npm run prettier` from the `provider/` directory to format the code.
