### Correct Solhint Errors and Warnigns

Solhint mostly follows the [official solidity style guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html),
but where they contradict one another, we conform to Solhint. For more information on how to install and run the
Solhint linter, please see [the README](README.md#solhint---solidity-linter).

### Follow the [Official Solidity Style Guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html)

Solhint doesn't check for all style violations. Where it doesn't, we follow the official solidity style guide. For
example, Solhint doesn't care about exactly how hanging indents are done. The solidity style guide indicates that they
should all have one more indent than the first line. We follow the solidity style guide and use a single hanging
indent.
