# Dapp Mining Examples

This contains examples of how to tag transactions with both Web3 and Ethers libraries.

These examples show how to tag your transactions when submitting a "create" request to the EMP.
The examples will output the data fields on the transaction you would need to sign. Use it as a starting
point to integrate the feature into your own front end.
