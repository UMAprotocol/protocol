/**
 * @title Extension of BeaconOracle that is intended to be deployed on Mainnet to give financial
 * contracts on non-Mainnet networks the ability to trigger cross-chain price requests to the Mainnet DVM. This contract
 * is responsible for triggering price requests originating from non-Mainnet, and broadcasting resolved price data
 * back to those networks. Technically, this contract is more of a Proxy than an Oracle, because it does not implement
 * the full Oracle interface including the getPrice and requestPrice methods. It's goal is to shuttle price request
 * functionality between L2 and L1.
 * @dev The intended client of this contract is some off-chain bot watching for resolved price events on the DVM. Once
 * that bot sees a price has resolved, it can call `publishPrice()` on this contract which will call the local Bridge
 * contract to signal to an off-chain relayer to bridge a price request to another network.
 * @dev This contract must be a registered financial contract in order to call DVM methods.
