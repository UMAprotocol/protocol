/**
 * @title Extension of BeaconOracle that is intended to be deployed on non-Mainnet networks to give financial
 * contracts on those networks the ability to trigger cross-chain price requests to the Mainnet DVM. Also has the
 * ability to receive published prices from Mainnet. This contract can be treated as the "DVM" for a non-Mainnet
 * network, because a calling contract can request and access a resolved price request from this contract.
 * @dev The intended client of this contract is an OptimisticOracle on a non-Mainnet network that needs price
 * resolution secured by the DVM on Mainnet. If a registered contract, such as the OptimisticOracle, calls
 * `requestPrice()` on this contract, then it will call the network's Bridge contract to signal to an off-chain
 * relayer to bridge a price request to Mainnet.
