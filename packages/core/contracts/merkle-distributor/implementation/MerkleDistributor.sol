     * @notice Set merkle root for the next available window index and seed allocations.
     * @notice Callable only by owner of this contract. Caller must have approved this contract to transfer
     *      `rewardsToDeposit` amount of `rewardToken` or this call will fail. Importantly, we assume that the
     *      owner of this contract correctly chooses an amount `rewardsToDeposit` that is sufficient to cover all
     *      claims within the `merkleRoot`. Otherwise, a race condition can be created. This situation can occur
     *      because we do not segregate reward balances by window, for code simplicity purposes.
     *      (If `rewardsToDeposit` is purposefully insufficient to payout all claims, then the admin must
     *      subsequently transfer in rewards or the following situation can occur).
     *      Example race situation:
     *          - Window 1 Tree: Owner sets `rewardsToDeposit=100` and insert proofs that give claimant A 50 tokens and
     *            claimant B 51 tokens. The owner has made an error by not setting the `rewardsToDeposit` correctly to 101.
     *          - Window 2 Tree: Owner sets `rewardsToDeposit=1` and insert proofs that give claimant A 1 token. The owner
     *            correctly set `rewardsToDeposit` this time.
     *          - At this point contract owns 100 + 1 = 101 tokens. Now, imagine the following sequence:
     *              (1) Claimant A claims 50 tokens for Window 1, contract now has 101 - 50 = 51 tokens.
     *              (2) Claimant B claims 51 tokens for Window 1, contract now has 51 - 51 = 0 tokens.
     *              (3) Claimant A tries to claim 1 token for Window 2 but fails because contract has 0 tokens.
     *          - In summary, the contract owner created a race for step(2) and step(3) in which the first claim would
     *            succeed and the second claim would fail, even though both claimants would expect their claims to succeed.
     * @param rewardsToDeposit amount of rewards to deposit to seed this allocation.
