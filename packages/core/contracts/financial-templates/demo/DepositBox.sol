/**
 * @title Token Deposit Box
 * @notice This is a minimal example of a financial template that depends on price requests from the DVM.
 * This contract should be thought of as a "Deposit Box" into which the user deposits some ERC20 collateral.
 * The main feature of this box is that the user can withdraw their ERC20 corresponding to a desired USD amount.
 * When the user wants to make a withdrawal, a price request is enqueued with the UMA DVM.
 * For simplicty, the user is constrained to have one outstanding withdrawal request at any given time.
 * Regular fees are charged on the collateral in the deposit box throughout the lifetime of the deposit box,
 * and final fees are charged on each price request.
 *
 * This example is intended to accompany a technical tutorial for how to integrate the DVM into a project.
 * The main feature this demo serves to showcase is how to build a financial product on-chain that "pulls" price
 * requests from the DVM on-demand, which is an implementation of the "priceless" oracle framework.
 *
 * The typical user flow would be:
 * - User sets up a deposit box for the (wETH - USD) price-identifier. The "collateral currency" in this deposit
 *   box is therefore wETH.
 *   The user can subsequently make withdrawal requests for USD-denominated amounts of wETH.
 * - User deposits 10 wETH into their deposit box.
 * - User later requests to withdraw $100 USD of wETH.
 * - DepositBox asks DVM for latest wETH/USD exchange rate.
 * - DVM resolves the exchange rate at: 1 wETH is worth 200 USD.
 * - DepositBox transfers 0.5 wETH to user.
