// The logger has a four different levels based on the severity of the incident:
// -> Debug. It can be considered a console log. Used periodically to inform status updates of repetitive state changes
//    like polling or no events found. Only viewable on GCE logs.
// -> Info. Used to report informative events, like a  liquidation/dispute/dispute settlement. These events are
//    noteworthy but don’t require action or acknowledgment from any
//    team member. Viewable on GCE logs and sends a slack message to appropriate channels.
// -> Warn. Used to report warning events that might require a response but don't necessarily indicate system failure.
//    Require Acknowledgment from the person on duty, or escalation occurs until the warning is acknowledged. For
//    example, warnings would be used to indicate that a bot’s balance has dropped below a given threshold or a
//    collateralization ratio of a given account moves below a threshold. Viewable on GCE logs, send a slack message to
//    the appropriate channel and initiates a PagerDuty incident with urgency set ‘low’.
// -> Error. Used to report system failure or situations that require an immediate response from appropriate team members.
//    For example, an error level message is generated when a liquidation/dispute/dispute settlement transaction from a
//    UMA bot reverts, token price deviates significantly from the target price or a bot crashes. Viewable on GCE logs,
//    send a slack message to the appropriate channel and initiates a PagerDuty incident with urgency setting ‘high’.

// calling debug/info/error logging requires an specificity formatted json object as a param for the logger.
// All objects must have an `at`, `message` as a minimum to describe where the error was logged from
// and what has occurred. Any addition key value pairing can be attached, including json objects which
// will be spread. A transaction should be within an object that contains a `tx` key containing the mined
// transaction hash. See `liquidator.js` for an example. An example object is shown below:

// Logger.error({
//   at: "liquidator",
//   message: "failed to withdraw rewards from liquidation",
//   address: liquidation.sponsor,
//   id: liquidation.id
// });
