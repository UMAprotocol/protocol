# Deprecate Oval Contracts

This directory contains scripts to deprecate Oval lock contracts on Ethereum mainnet by setting their lock window to 0 and renouncing ownership. The scripts generate a Safe Multisig transaction payload that can be imported into the Gnosis Safe Transaction Builder UI.

## Overview

The script will generate a JSON payload containing 2 transactions per contract:

1. `setLockWindow(0)` - Sets the lock window to zero
2. `renounceOwnership()` - Renounces ownership (sets owner to 0x0)

Target contracts are specified via the `TARGET_CONTRACTS` environment variable as a comma-separated list.

## Prerequisites

Build the packages from the root of the repository:

```sh
yarn && yarn build
```

## Testing on Forked Network

### 1. Spin up a forked mainnet node

In a separate terminal:

```sh
HARDHAT_CHAIN_ID=1 yarn hardhat node --fork <YOUR-MAINNET-RPC-URL> --port 8545 --no-deploy
```

### 2. Export required environment variables

```sh
export TARGET_CONTRACTS="0xAddress1,0xAddress2,0xAddress3"
export SAFE_ADDRESS=<YOUR-SAFE-MULTISIG-ADDRESS>
export NODE_URL_1=http://localhost:8545
```

Note: The `SAFE_ADDRESS` should be the Gnosis Safe multisig that owns these contracts.

### 3. Generate and simulate the payload

```sh
yarn hardhat run packages/scripts/src/admin-proposals/deprecate-oval-contracts/0_GeneratePayload.ts --network localhost
```

This will:

- Generate the JSON payload file at `packages/scripts/out/deprecate-oval-contracts_1.json`
- Simulate the execution on the forked network by impersonating the Safe owners
- Execute all transactions atomically through the Safe (2 transactions per contract)

### 4. Verify the changes

```sh
yarn hardhat run packages/scripts/src/admin-proposals/deprecate-oval-contracts/1_Verify.ts --network localhost
```

This will verify that:

- All contracts have `lockWindow` set to 0
- All contracts have ownership renounced (owner is 0x0)

## Production Use on Mainnet

### 1. Export required environment variables

```sh
export TARGET_CONTRACTS="0xAddress1,0xAddress2,0xAddress3"
export SAFE_ADDRESS=<YOUR-SAFE-MULTISIG-ADDRESS>
export NODE_URL_1=<YOUR-MAINNET-RPC-URL>
```

### 2. Generate the payload

```sh
yarn hardhat run packages/scripts/src/admin-proposals/deprecate-oval-contracts/0_GeneratePayload.ts --network mainnet
```

This will generate `packages/scripts/out/deprecate-oval-contracts_1.json`

### 3. Import into Gnosis Safe Transaction Builder

1. Navigate to your Safe at https://app.safe.global/
2. Go to "Transaction Builder" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create Batch"
4. Click "Upload a JSON file"
5. Select the generated `deprecate-oval-contracts_1.json` file
6. Review the transactions (2 per contract):
   - `setLockWindow(0)` calls
   - `renounceOwnership()` calls
7. Create the batch transaction
8. Sign and execute with required Safe signers

### 4. Verify on mainnet

After the Safe transaction is executed:

```sh
yarn hardhat run packages/scripts/src/admin-proposals/deprecate-oval-contracts/1_Verify.ts --network mainnet
```

This will confirm all contracts have been successfully deprecated.
